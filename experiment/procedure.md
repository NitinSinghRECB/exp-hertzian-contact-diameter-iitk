# **7. Brief Experimental Procedure**

## **Step 1: Surface Preparation**
- Section and mount sample  
- Grind using SiC papers  
- Polish using diamond/alumina suspensions  
- Achieve mirror finish  
- Clean with ethanol/acetone  

A smooth surface minimizes roughness errors.

---

## **Step 2: Align the Indenter**
- Place sample on stage  
- Clamp rigidly  
- Use optical system to align indenter normally  

Ensures symmetric contact and avoids lateral forces.

---

## **Step 3: Calibrate Tip Radius & Sensors**
- Verify tip radius (sensitive parameter)  
- Calibrate load frame compliance  
- Confirm displacement sensor accuracy  

Good calibration ensures precision in \(a\), \(A\), \(p_m\), and \(p_0\).

---

## **Step 4: Apply Low Load (Elastic Regime)**
- Use a small load to stay within elastic deformation  
- Increase load gradually  
- Avoid plasticity during testing  

---

## **Step 5: Record Load–Displacement Curve**
- Continuously capture **P–h** curve  
- Include loading + unloading  
- Optional hold segment to reduce creep  

This curve is the core dataset for contact mechanics evaluation.

---

## **Step 6: Determine Stiffness & Reduced Modulus**
- Obtain contact stiffness:  
  \[
  S = \frac{dP}{dh}
  \]
- Use S and contact equations to calculate \(E^*\)

---

## **Step 7: Compute Contact Radius, Area & Pressures**
Use Hertz equations to find:

- Contact radius: \(a\)  
- Contact area: \(A = \pi a^2\)  
- Mean pressure: \(p_m = P/A\)  
- Maximum pressure: \(p_0\)

These predict likelihood of yielding or damage.

---

## **Step 8: Repeat & Average**
- Perform multiple indents  
- Avoid overlapping plastic zones  
- Average results for improved reliability
