    {
      "question": "If the applied load is doubled in an elastic contact, the contact pressure will generally:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decrease",
        "b": "Remain constant",
        "c": "Increase",
        "d": "Become zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Increasing load increases stress, not decreases it.",
        "b": "Incorrect: Pressure changes with load and area.",
        "c": "Correct: Higher load produces higher stresses, increasing both mean and maximum contact pressure.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Pressure cannot become zero under load."

      "question": "Hertzian contact pressure analysis is mainly useful for predicting:",

        "a": "Density",

        "c": "Contact-induced damage",
        "d": "Thermal expansion"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Density is not related to Hertzian mechanics.",
        "b": "Incorrect: Grain size is a microstructural property unrelated to contact stress calculations.",
        "c": "Correct: Hertzian analysis helps predict yielding, cracking, and wear due to localized stress.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Hertzian theory does not address thermal expansion."

      "question": "The projected contact area in Hertzian contact is directly determined by:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Hardness",
        "b": "Contact radius",
        "c": "Holding time",
        "d": "Temperature"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Hardness does not define the geometric contact area in Hertzian theory.",
        "b": "Correct: Projected area A = πa², which depends directly on the contact radius.",
        "c": "Incorrect: Holding time does not affect Hertzian contact geometry.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Contact area does not directly depend on temperature in elastic theory."

      "question": "Very high contact pressure during sliding or indentation typically leads to:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Purely elastic recovery",
        "b": "No deformation",
        "c": "Plastic flow and wear",
        "d": "Surface polishing only"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: High pressure often exceeds yield strength, causing plasticity.",
        "b": "Incorrect: High stresses always produce deformation.",
        "c": "Correct: When stress exceeds yield strength, permanent deformation occurs, resulting in plastic flow and wear.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Surface polishing is not the dominant mechanism under high stress."
