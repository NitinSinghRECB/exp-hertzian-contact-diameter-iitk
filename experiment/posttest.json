      "explanations": {
        "a": "A higher load produces larger stresses in the contact zone, increasing both mean and maximum pressures.",

        "a": "Localized contact stresses determine when yielding, cracking, or wear begins, making Hertzian analysis useful for tribological predictions.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "The contact area is calculated as A=πa^2, so it depends directly on the contact radius.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "When stresses exceed the yield strength, permanent deformation and material removal occur, resulting in wear damage.",
