        "a": "Plastic",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Hertzian theory does not describe plastic deformation.",
        "b": "Correct: Hertzian theory assumes purely elastic, fully recoverable deformation.",
        "c": "Incorrect: Creep is time-dependent deformation, not assumed in Hertzian theory.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Viscous deformation is not considered in Hertzian elastic contact."

      "question": "The contact area between an indenter and a surface increases with:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Lower load",
        "b": "Higher modulus",
        "c": "Higher load",
        "d": "Lower indenter radius"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Lower load reduces penetration and contact area.",
        "b": "Incorrect: Higher modulus reduces deformation, often decreasing contact area.",
        "c": "Correct: Increasing load pushes the indenter deeper, increasing the contact radius and area.",
        "d": "Incorrect: A smaller indenter radius produces smaller contact area for the same load."

      "question": "In Hertzian contact, the maximum shear stress occurs:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "At the edge of contact",

        "c": "Below the surface",
        "d": "Uniformly everywhere"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Stresses are not maximum at the edge.",
        "b": "Incorrect: Normal stress is highest at the center, but shear stress is not.",
        "c": "Correct: Peak shear stress occurs slightly below the surface, often initiating subsurface cracks or yielding.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Stress distribution is highly non-uniform in contact mechanics."

      "question": "If the contact radius becomes smaller for the same load, the contact pressure will:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decrease",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Smaller area does not reduce pressure.",
        "b": "Correct: Pressure = Load / Area. Smaller area increases contact stress.",
        "c": "Incorrect: Pressure depends on area and will change.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Pressure cannot be zero under applied load."
