        "a": "Hertzian theory is derived using linear elastic mechanics and assumes all deformation is recoverable with no permanent plastic damage.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Increasing load pushes the indenter deeper into the surface, enlarging the contact radius and therefore increasing the projected contact area.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Stress analysis shows that peak shear stress develops slightly beneath the surface, which often initiates subsurface yielding or cracking.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Pressure equals load divided by area; a smaller area concentrates the same force, producing higher contact stress.",
